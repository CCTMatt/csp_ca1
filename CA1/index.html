        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The Book of Kells is one of the finest and most famous, and also one of the latest, of a group of manuscripts
            in
            what is known as the Insular style, produced from the late 6th through the early 9th centuries in
            monasteries in
            Ireland, Scotland and England and in continental monasteries with Hiberno-Scottish or Anglo-Saxon
            foundations.<sup>[2]</sup> These manuscripts include the Cathach of St. Columba, the Ambrosiana Orosius,
            fragmentary Gospel
            in the Durham Dean and Chapter Library (all from the early 7th century), and the Book of Durrow (from the
            second
            half of the 7th century). From the early 8th century come the Durham Gospels, the Echternach Gospels, the
            Lindisfarne Gospels (see illustration at right), and the Lichfield Gospels. Among others, the St. Gall
            Gospel
            Book belongs to the late 8th century and the Book of Armagh (dated to 807–809) to the early 9th
            century.<sup>[3][4]</sup>

        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>The Book of Kells contains the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and
            yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of Gospel
            passages.<sup>[33]</sup> Today, it consists of 340 vellum leaves, or folios, totalling 680
            pages.,<sup>[34]</sup> Almost all folios
            are numbered at recto, bottom left. One folio number, 36, was mistakenly double-counted. As a result, the
            pagination of the entire book is reckoned thus: folio 1r — 36v, 36*r — 36*v (the double-counted folio), and
            37r — 339v.<sup>[30]</sup> The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets, called bifolios, which are
            folded in
            half to form two folios. The bifolios are nested inside of each other and sewn together to form gatherings
            called quires. On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolio but is instead a single sheet inserted within a
            quire. The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires.<sup>[35]</sup> There are between four and twelve
            folios (two to
            six bifolios) per quire; the folios are commonly, but not invariably, bound in groups of ten. Some folios
            are single sheets, as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages. The folios had lines drawn
            for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolios were folded. Prick marks and guidelines can still
            be seen on some pages.<sup>[30]</sup> The vellum is of high quality, although the folios have an uneven
            thickness, with
            some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent. As many as twelve
            individuals may have collaborated on the book's production, of whom four scribes and three painters have
            been distinguished.<sup>[36][37]</sup></p>
